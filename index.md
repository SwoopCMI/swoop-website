  - title: WORKFLOW.
    description: >
        We all live and work in different environments, and follow processes to achieve our goals. 
        Swoop have proved that by designing technological solutions to automate the flows of data, 
        images, information, notification and tasks, the process of working can be simplified and 
        inherent risks involved in complex organisations significantly reduced.

  - title: COMMUNICATION.
    description: >
        Providing advanced communication solutions is core to everything we deliver. 
        Communications, and the technical ability to improve on how information is passed around, 
        is fundamental to the projects we work on with clients - enabling better communication 
        flows between specific locations, colleagues or end customers to improve efficiency, 
        reduce time wastage and ultimately increase revenue.

  - title: DESIGN.
    description: >
        The importance of design, and the way that strong and intuitive design can positively
         influence the user experience is integral to all the projects we undertake. Simple, 
         well constructed, and appropriate design brings about solutions that entirely meet 
         the needs of the user, regardless of the ultimate objective of the technology.
